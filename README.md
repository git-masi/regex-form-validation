# Regex Form Validation

Where possible it is a good practice to use the HTML input "pattern" attribute for form validation. Materialize CSS (and other CSS frameworks/libraries) already provides styling for valid/invalid inputs using the .validate class. But in the cases where form validation using regular expressions is desired this repo provides a useful library of basic validations.
